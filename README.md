# ScanDB

This is an initial draft version of a database to keep track of authorized scanning of networks.
The basic idea is that a client authorizes a scan for a specific network. The pentester doing the scan uses one to multiple scanners with multiple scan modules for each IP address in every network range of the client.

## Installation

(Assuming you use Ubuntu or Debian)

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
git clone https://github.com/aaronkaplan/scandb.git
cd scandb
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install django
pip install psycopg2
pip install djangorestframework
```

Next edit the settings.py file:
```bash
vi scandb/settings.py
```

Change `SECRET_KEY = 'XXXX'` to some very long random string.


Create a postgresql DB:
```bash
sudo -u postgres createdb scandb
```

Download the netfields package:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jimfunk/django-postgresql-netfields.git netfields
cd netfields
python setup.py install
```


Finally, install the fixtures:
```bash
./manage.py loaddata -v 2 fixtures/scanners.json
```



## TODOs
  * add subtable (inheritance!) for:
    * Nessus
    * Nmap
    * Acunetix
    * ...
  * <del> DONE load the most common scanners (see above) as fixtures into the "scanner" table </del>
  * make a script to load Nessus/nmap/... scans into the scan result table
  * find a **comparable** metric  (does not need to be perfect! Just an indication of progress!) for scan results (e.g. a number between 1 and 10). Assign each scan result a metric score.
  * visualise scores (for details as well as aggregated averages) for scans
